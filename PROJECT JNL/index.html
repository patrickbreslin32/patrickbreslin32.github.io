        <p>At the conclusion of every National Football League (NFL) season, a panel of 50 sportswriters assess players' performances and contributions throughout the regular season. Individual brilliance is celebrated through a series of awards that honor outstanding performances and contributions. The most prestigious honors include the Most Valuable Player (MVP), Offensive and Defensive Player of the Year, Offensive and Defensive Rookie of the Year, and more. Every NFL award has its own set of criteria designed to honor achievement in a particular area of the game. Voters take into account a variety of factors, including statistical accomplishments, impact on team performance, leadership traits, and overall contribution to the game, while evaluating offensive prowess, defensive mastery, rookie promise, or sportsmanship.</p> 
        <p>Experts, journalists, and former players make up the panel that selects the NFL awards, and they vote according to preset standards. This guarantees a thorough assessment of applicants in every category. Different awards may have different voting procedures, such as direct player or coach voting or ranking systems, with the highest number of votes cast determining the winner. For example, Kansas City Chiefs star quarterback, Patrick Mahomes, received 48 out of 50 first place votes for the MVP award. Voters credited Mahomes for guiding the Chiefs to the best record in the league (14-3) while providing impressive statistics: Mahomes threw for a league-leading 41 touchdowns and 5,250 passing yards.</p>
        <p>With all of the intangibles presented in an MVP race, individual statistics remain to be the driving factor in determining the winner. Bertram Probyn, a teaching assistant for sport philosophy at Syracuse University, claims that the MVP should be given to whoever has the best statistics.</p>
        <p>"I think that deciding the MVP is extremely hard to tell because of the different situations that the players are in," said Probyn. "Some players only do well in certain teams, and what makes them perform at their best depends on the dynamic of their team. One can only judge their performance based on individual statistics, and how they compare with their counterparts."</p>

          According to Caeser's Sportsbook, PointsBet, and Vegas Insider Betting, San Fransisco 49ers QB Brock Purdy is the MVP Favorite. Purdy has thrown 23 touchdowns, 6 interceptions, and leads the league with a 116.1 passer rating.| Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images

          <p>So far in the 2023 NFL Season, there has been much debate over who is deserving of this award. Miami Dolphins Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa was the favorite for the award in the first half of the season, as he led the Dolphins' offense to a historic start, which included a dominant 70 point outing versus the Denver Broncos in Week 3. San Francisco 49ers Running Back Christain McCaffrey has produced a dominant season, leading the league in rushing yards and touchdowns scored. McCaffrey's value stems from his versatility: he is such a strong runner, defenses are frequently forced to play eight in the box. Moreover, most defenses have no linebacker or safety that can cover McCaffrey man-to-man since he is such a superb receiver that he forces them to play zone coverage most of the time. Thus, he also facilitates the lives of his teammates.</p>
          <p>Buffalo Bills Quarterback Josh Allen has had an excellent season, throwing for 24 touchdowns through 12 weeks. However, his name isn't mentioned with the other favorites due to his team record. The Buffalo Bills are currently 6-6 and out of the playoff picture, but upcoming games against the Kansas City Chiefs and Dallas Cowboys can bolster Allen's case for the final stretch of the season. The other marquee MVP candidate is Philadelphia Eagles Quarterback Jalen Hurts. Hurts, who came second in MVP voting last year, has 31 total touchdowns while leading the Eagles to a 10-2 record, the best in the NFL.</p>
          <p>Despite the performances of all these players, the two favorites for MVP as of Week 13 are Brock Purdy and Dak Prescott. Although the odds differ from Vegas' respective gambling sites, the two quarterbacks lead the pack in this intriguing NFL MVP Race. </p>
          <p>Purdy has helped the powerful San Francisco 49ers to a 10-3 record, while Prescott has led the Dallas Cowboys to an identical record. Purdy and the 49ers beat the Cowboys 42-10 in Week 5, with Purdy throwing 4 touchdowns and Prescott throwing 3 interceptions: this could be a decisive factor in the MVP race, and it is fair to say that their teams may face each other in this upcoming playoffs once again.</p>

        <h1>How Do The 2023 NFL MVP Candidates Compare To Previous Winners?</h1>

      <img class="story_image" src="images/img1.jpg" alt="">

  

      <p>The 2023 NFL season has been unique for many reasons. The same can be said about the MVP race, as there has been no consistent favorite since the first week of the season. Entering the season, Patrick Mahomes was a slight betting favorite over Joe Burrow and Josh Allen. No quarterback has put up historical numbers that would make them an obvious favorite. If a running back were to win the award, it would definitely be Christain McCaffrey. However, it has been 11 years since a running back last won the award.</p>
      <p>Although a plethora of quarterbacks have put up impressive numbers in regards to passing yards and passing touchdowns, the number of interceptions and fumbles have risen all across the league. I examined the MVP winners of the twenty-first century in detail to demonstrate the caliber of these players. My goal was to ascertain the reason for their victory and identify any trends that could lead to the prediction of the 2023 NFL MVP winner.</p>

            <h1>Is the MVP just a Quarterback Award?</h1>
    
          <img class="story_image" src="images/img1.jpg" alt="">
        
      
      <p>The NFL MVP award has been presented since 1957. Despite this, only 18 recipients played a position that was outside of a quarterback. Since 2000, there have only been three non-quarterbacks that have won the award: Marshall Faulk (2000), Shaun Alexander (2005), LaDainian Tomlinson (2006), and Adrian Peterson (2012). The main thing that these three have in common is that they each played the running back positions. Faulk, Alexander, and Peterson put up astronomical numbers and carried their offenses to winning records. Peterson, the last non-quarterback to win the award, was 9 yards short of breaking the single-season rushing record, and yet barely won the award over Denver Broncos Quarterback Peyton Manning. </p>
      <p>"The quarterback position is unquestionably the most valuable in the NFL," said Potryn. "The quarterback is the focal point of a team's offensive strategy and is responsible for making all of the important decisions."</p>
      <p>Since they are viewed as the team's public face, quarterbacks are known for their leadership abilities off the field. Their capacity to uplift and encourage coworkers has a big impact on the dynamics of the team. Since quarterback performance directly affects game outcomes, an NFL team's success is often linked to their play.</p>
      <p>Poetry proceeds to claim that although quarterback is the most valuable position, other positions are also deserving of the award.</p>
      <p>"If a player is indisputably the best player in the league despite not being a quarterback, then they deserve the award."</p>

       <p class="caption">A quarterback has won the NFL MVP award every season since 2012.</p>

      <p>This graphic puts into perspective what the average MVP produces statistically per year. Although it's a subjective process and voters may give varying consideration to different factors, a player is frequently chosen the NFL MVP when they combine outstanding individual performance, team success, leadership traits, and impact during pivotal times.</p>

      <p>A strong argument can be made that a non-QB should win the 2023 NFL season, as no quarterback has put up numbers that are historic. Historical examples include Peyton Manning in 2013, as he won the MVP after breaking up single season NFL records. Not only did he throw for a record 55 touchdowns and 5,477 yards, but he helped the Denver Broncos score the most points ever in a single season (606). Likewise, in 2018, Patrick Mahomes won the MVP after throwing for 50 touchdowns and over 5,000 yards in his first season as an NFL starting quarterback.</p>

      <p>While no quarterback is on pace for such historical statistics, Miami Dolphins Wide Receiver Tyreek Hill is on pace to shatter records that were never thought to be broken. In 2012, former Detroit Lions Wide Receiver Calvin Johnson set the single season receiving yardage record with 1,964. The closest player to break this record was Cooper Kupp just two seasons ago, yet he finished outside the top two in MVP conversation.</p>
      <p>Hill is arguably the most valuable player to his team, as the Dolphins currently hold the number 1 seed in the American Football Conference (AFC). Hill is on pace to break Johnson's 11 year record by over 130 yards. Hill's success in football can be attributed to a combination of extraordinary physical abilities, versatile skills, football intelligence, and a strong work ethic. His unique skill set makes him a game-changer and a constant threat on the field. Known for his incredible speed, Hill's ability to accelerate quickly and reach top speed in a short distance is a significant asset.</p>

      <p>With five regular season games left in the season, the MVP race may shift significantly. Voters' perceptions could be greatly influenced by certain performances at pivotal occasions at this stage in the season. In regards to playoff implications, players who perform well in these final games will be given greater consideration for the MVP award. Great plays, winning performances, or a player's constant great play could tip the scales in favor of that player. Additionally, injuries or unexpected setbacks could massively affect the MVP competition. If a player suffers an injury or notices a drop in production, it could allow other competitors to take the lead.</p>
